# Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. 
# The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.
# Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employee_id,
CASE WHEN employee_id%2 <> 0 AND name NOT like 'M%' then salary

end as bonus

# Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single # update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.
# Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.
